title: Welcome to Erov's Note

Ever since mankind rose from the dust of the Earth, there has been theological warfare.

From the First Sacred War, to Soga-Mononobe, to the Crusades, humanity's history of conflict has always been intertwined with the divine. Religion has been consequential in both mediating and sparking strife across the Earth, whether it served to bring groups into harmony or create tension amongst men. The lives and deaths of millions have been irrevocably modified by the societal inertia of generational worship. This fact is undisputed.

And yet the wheels of history have not solely been turned by the hands of men acting on behalf of lofty Names. The divine itself has always played a role in the shape of our existence — not solely as ideals or metaphors, but as concrete parties, interfering with the course of fate to achieve their goals. From the time of Gilgamesh to the modern age, it was these beings whom the world was predicated on, pillars of whom people of unshakable faith would rely when all hope was lost. And it was these beings who, in turn, granted boons and blessings to their followers.

But as the wheel turned and the engine rose, the shackles of the divine had lost their grip upon the Earth. The Enlightenment and subsequent schools of thought exposed the fundamental flaws underpinning the deific theocracy — that the gods' existence were built on belief itself. And without this belief, they could be killed or crippled — like mortal men.

But to undermine a god to the point of its nadir, you must destroy the belief that gives it form.

These concepts were purely theoretical — until they weren't. The world was torn asunder by the Second World War, and beneath the surface of the veil the Seventh Occult War ravaged across Europe with intense ferocity. It was during these times that mankind came to understand the strength of divinity, and as the Axis Powers began to dip their toes into controlling this untapped well, the Allies took heed. Although no major deific weapons were ultimately used in combat, this event opened a new Pandora's Box of horrors onto the Earth.

It has been over half a century since that point. Humanity has successfully built its Tower of Babel, and now we stand among the heavens looking down upon all that once stood above. But humanity, as it is, is no monolith — and if we do not maintain cohesion among our nations, we are surely to find ourselves planted firmly on the soil, a foreign tongue in each of our mouths.

While working for us, you will see men of great faith die horrible deaths. You will see blasphemous rituals, absurd caricatures of lofty beings, and horrors beyond the mind's eye. You will see weapons forged in holy calculus and guns pointed at the heads of the demiurge. But throughout all of this, you must remember one thing, and one thing only:  

  
If you can kill it, it isn't a God.
